# AWS Perimeter Mod for Steampipe

An AWS perimeter checking tool that can be used to look for resources that are publicly accessible, shared with untrusted accounts, have insecure network configurations, and more.

Run checks in a dashboard:

Or in a terminal:

Includes support for:

* [Network Access](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws-perimeter/controls/benchmark.network_access)
* [Public Access](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws-perimeter/controls/benchmark.public_access)
* [Shared Access](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws-perimeter/controls/benchmark.shared_access)

## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe
```

Install the AWS plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```sh
steampipe plugin install aws
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-perimeter.git
cd steampipe-mod-aws-perimeter
```

### Usage

Start your dashboard server to get started:

```sh
steampipe dashboard
```

By default, the dashboard interface will then be launched in a new browser
window at http://localhost:9194. From here, you can run benchmarks by
selecting one or searching for a specific one.

Instead of running benchmarks in a dashboard, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `steampipe check` command:

Run all benchmarks:

```sh
steampipe check all
```

Run a single benchmark:

```sh
steampipe check benchmark.public_access
```

Run a specific control:

```sh
steampipe check control.ec2_instance_ami_prohibit_public_access
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/cli/check#output-formats).

### Credentials

This mod uses the credentials configured in the [Steampipe AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws).

### Configuration

Several benchmarks have [input variables](https://steampipe.io/docs/using-steampipe/mod-variables) that can be configured to better match your environment and requirements. Each variable has a default defined in its source file, e.g., `perimeter/shared_access.sp`, but these can be overwritten in several ways:

- Copy and rename the `steampipe.spvars.example` file to `steampipe.spvars`, and then modify the variable values inside that file
- Pass in a value on the command line:

  ```shell
  steampipe check benchmark.shared_access --var='trusted_accounts=["123456789012", "123123123123"]'
  ```

- Set an environment variable:

  ```shell
  SP_VAR_trusted_accounts='["123456789012", "123123123123"]' steampipe check control.ram_resource_shared_with_trusted_accounts
  ```

  - Note: When using environment variables, if the variable is defined in `steampipe.spvars` or passed in through the command line, either of those will take precedence over the environment variable value. For more information on variable definition precedence, please see the link below.

These are only some of the ways you can set variables. For a full list, please see [Passing Input Variables](https://steampipe.io/docs/using-steampipe/mod-variables#passing-input-variables).

### Common and Tag Dimensions

The benchmark queries use common properties (like `account_id`, `connection_name` and `region`) and tags that are defined in the form of a default list of strings in the `mod.sp` file. These properties can be overwritten in several ways:

- Copy and rename the `steampipe.spvars.example` file to `steampipe.spvars`, and then modify the variable values inside that file
- Pass in a value on the command line:

  ```shell
  steampipe check benchmark.public_access_settings --var 'common_dimensions=["account_id", "connection_name", "region"]'
  ```

  ```shell
  steampipe check benchmark.public_access_settings --var 'tag_dimensions=["Environment", "Owner"]'
  ```

- Set an environment variable:

  ```shell
  SP_VAR_common_dimensions='["account_id", "connection_name", "region"]' steampipe check control.eks_cluster_endpoint_prohibit_public_access
  ```

  ```shell
  SP_VAR_tag_dimensions='["Environment", "Owner"]' steampipe check control.large_ebs_volumes
  ```
