# AWS Perimeter Mod for Powerpipe

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [Powerpipe](https://powerpipe.io) is now the preferred way to run this mod! [Migrating from Steampipe →](https://powerpipe.io/blog/migrating-from-steampipe)
>
> All v0.x versions of this mod will work in both Steampipe and Powerpipe, but v1.0.0 onwards will be in Powerpipe format only.

An AWS perimeter checking tool that can be used to look for resources that are publicly accessible, shared with untrusted accounts, have insecure network configurations, and more.

Run checks in a dashboard:

Or in a terminal:

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws) as the data source. Install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install aws
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default AWS credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple accounts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#multi-account-connections) or [customize AWS credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#configuring-aws-credentials).

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
mkdir dashboards
cd dashboards
powerpipe mod init
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-perimeter
```

### Browsing Dashboards

Start Steampipe as the data source:

```sh
steampipe service start
```

Start the dashboard server:

```sh
powerpipe server
```

Browse and view your dashboards at **http://localhost:9033**.

### Running Checks in Your Terminal

Instead of running benchmarks in a dashboard, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `powerpipe benchmark` command:

List available benchmarks:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark list
```

Run a benchmark:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run public_access
```

Run a specific control:

```sh
powerpipe control run ec2_instance_ami_prohibit_public_access
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://powerpipe.io/docs/reference/cli/benchmark#output-formats).

### Configure Variables

Several benchmarks have [input variables](https://powerpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables#input-variables) that can be configured to better match your environment and requirements. Each variable has a default defined in its source file, e.g., `perimeter/shared_access.sp`, but these can be overwritten in several ways:

It's easiest to setup your vars file, starting with the sample:

```sh
cp steampipe.spvars.example steampipe.spvars
vi steampipe.spvars
```

Alternatively you can pass variables on the command line:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run shared_access --var='trusted_accounts=["123456789012", "123123123123"]'
```

Or through environment variables:

```sh
export PP_VAR_trusted_accounts='["123456789012", "123123123123"]'
powerpipe control run ram_resource_shared_with_trusted_accounts
```

These are only some of the ways you can set variables. For a full list, please see [Passing Input Variables](https://powerpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables#passing-input-variables).

### Common and Tag Dimensions

The benchmark queries use common properties (like `account_id`, `connection_name` and `region`) and tags that are defined in the form of a default list of strings in the `variables.sp` file. These properties can be overwritten in several ways:

It's easiest to setup your vars file, starting with the sample:

```sh
cp steampipe.spvars.example steampipe.spvars
vi steampipe.spvars
```

Alternatively you can pass variables on the command line:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run public_access_settings --var 'common_dimensions=["account_id", "connection_name", "region"]'
```

Or through environment variables:

```sh
export PP_VAR_common_dimensions='["account_id", "connection_name", "region"]'
powerpipe control run eks_cluster_endpoint_prohibit_public_access
```
