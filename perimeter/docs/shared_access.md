## Shared Access

Sharing a resource makes it available for use by principals outside of the AWS account that created the resource. Sharing doesn't change any permissions or quotas that apply to the resource in the account that created it. The shared access benchmark detects your cloud resources shared with intended and trusted AWS accounts or organisations.
