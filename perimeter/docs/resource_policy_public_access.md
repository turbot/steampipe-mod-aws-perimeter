This benchmark answers the following questions:

- What resources have resource policies that allow public access?

**Note**: This benchmark does not currently evaluate conditions and errs on the side of declaring false positives. In an upcoming release, these queries will be updated to evaluate conditions and reduce the number of false positives (while minimizing false negatives).
