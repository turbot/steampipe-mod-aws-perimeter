## Network Access

Network is shared among IaaS consumers, and it is essential to secure the network traffic and the cloudâ€™s environment from being exploited by unauthorized consumers. Thus, access control for network boundaries and allowlists for network communications are required and may be applied following recommended industry-standard best practices.

The network access benchmark is designed to detect your cloud resources which are at a risk of malicious or unauthorized traffic due to network misconfigurations such as security group, route table, and association of public IP with any instances.
