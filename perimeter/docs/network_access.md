## Network Access

A network is essential to secure the network traffic and the cloudâ€™s environment from being exploited by unauthorized consumers. Thus, access control for network boundaries and allowlists for network communications are required and may be applied following recommended industry-standard best practices.

The network access benchmark checks for resources which are at a risk of malicious or unauthorized traffic due to network misconfigurations such as security group rules and public IP addresses.
